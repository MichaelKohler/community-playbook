# Community mobilization

We want to create a voice dataset that is publicly available to anyone and represents the world we live in. 
By mobilizing communities and contributors we are able to achieve this goal. 

This page links to resources and ideas you can use to help advocate for Common Voice in your language community.

⭐️ You can re-use any graphical material we have produced to support the project.
