# üåç Localization

### Our purpose

Adapting the project tools and material to be understood by a specific audience. This includes translation of text for contributors in their spoken languages. 

### Who we are

We are a community of translators and linguists that localize the original English content into our languages.

üî® _English knowledge and deep understanding of our local language and culture are key for this work._

### What‚Äôs success

Localize the project tools into our language, mainly the [Common Voice site](http://voice.mozilla.org/).

* The Common Voice site is 100% localized in my language.

### How to join

Anyone can join this community. Join our [discourse forums](https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/voice/) or our [matrix chat](https://chat.mozilla.org/#/room/#common-voice:mozilla.org) and introduce yourself, jump into our localization tool and check the status of your language.

### What we do

#### **Localization**

We use Mozilla‚Äôs localization tool, Pontoon, to translate the Common Voice strings. Please create an account and check your language on [Common Voice Pontoon section](https://pontoon.mozilla.org/projects/common-voice/).

‚ÑπÔ∏è _Please read [how to use pontoon](https://mozilla-l10n.github.io/localizer-documentation/tools/pontoon/) before starting to use the tool, you might need to ask the Mozilla localization team for permissions to validate suggestions_.

üî® _Skills required to help: English knowledge, strong knowledge of your language._

### Roles

These are some roles you can take as part of this community.

* Localizer: Suggest new translations for the pending strings
* Reviewer: Check and validate existing suggestions and improve their quality.
* Mobilizer: Help people in the community to get started and keep contributing.


### Channels

* [Common Voice discourse](https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/voice/) category.
* [Common Voice matrix](https://chat.mozilla.org/#/room/#common-voice:mozilla.org) chat room.
* [Mozilla Localization matrix](https://chat.mozilla.org/#/room/#l10n-community:mozilla.org) chat room.
* [Common Voice project announcements](https://discourse.mozilla.org/tags/c/voice/announcements).


üí¨ If your language already exists on Common Voice, make sure you [check and join the local discourse](https://voice.mozilla.org/about#get-involved) and matrix room. If that‚Äôs not the case, please create a new topic [on discourse](https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/voice/239) asking for one to be created.
