# Maintenance page

The Mozilla Common Voice community playbook is coordinated by the community manager and maintained by Common Voice reps. 

The playbook is a living document, we welcome suggestions that make this playbook relevant. 

**Submitting content for the playbook**:

Please use the issue form called [feature request](https://github.com/common-voice/community-playbook/issues/new/choose), which could be valuable to all and other language communities on Common Voice. This could be a case study, change request for links, or a copy suggestion.

*The feature request form was adapted from the [Turing Way Community Playbook](https://zenodo.org/record/3233986#.YVHB5aDTVQI)*

## Maintenance cycle [draft]

**Content and Issue request**: 

Features such as format changes, new pages are reviewed in a 7-week cycle
E.g. hosting the playbook on gitbooks, search button  

**Quick fixes**:

Requests that take less than 30 mins to deliver and are urgent should be reviewed and deployed in a 2-week cycle
E.g  new case study, a new document 

## How to localize the playbook [TBD]

We would like to host the playbook on another platform that will enable us to easily localize the playbook.
